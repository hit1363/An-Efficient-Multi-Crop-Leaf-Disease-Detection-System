## 🏗️ Architecture

### Clean Architecture Pattern
```
Presentation Layer (Screens & Widgets)
         ↓
Business Logic Layer (Services)
         ↓
Data Layer (Models & Database)
```

### Key Design Patterns
- **Singleton**: Services (MLService, DatabaseService, etc.)
- **Factory**: Model deserialization
- **Observer**: State management with Provider
- **Strategy**: Image preprocessing
- **Repository**: Database operations

### Service Layer
```
MLService → TFLite Interpreter
DatabaseService → SQLite Database
DiseaseInfoService → JSON Data
CameraService → Camera Controller
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before Release
1. **Add Model File**: Copy `model.tflite` to `assets/models/`
2. **Test on Devices**: Test on multiple Android/iOS devices
3. **Configure Signing**: Set up Android keystore and iOS certificates
4. **Update Assets**: Add app icons and splash screens
5. **Review Permissions**: Ensure all permissions are justified
6. **Test Offline**: Verify offline functionality
7. **Performance Test**: Profile memory and CPU usage

### Model Requirements
- Model file must be named `model.tflite`
- Must be INT8 quantized for mobile
- Input shape: [1, 224, 224, 3]
- Output shape: [1, 34]
- Labels must match `labels.txt` order

### Platform-Specific
- **Android**: Update `build.gradle` min SDK to 21
- **iOS**: Configure camera permissions in Info.plist
- **Both**: Test on real devices (emulators may have issues with TFLite)
