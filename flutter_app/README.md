flutter doctor
```

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   cd "An Efficient Multi-Crop Leaf Disease Detection System/flutter_app"
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Add Model File**
   ```bash
   # After training (see ../training/README.md)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Model file not found
```
Solution: Ensure model.tflite exists in assets/models/
Run: flutter clean && flutter pub get
```

**Issue**: Camera permission denied
```
Solution: Grant permissions in device settings
For Android: Settings > Apps > App Name > Permissions
For iOS: Settings > Privacy > Camera
```

**Issue**: Slow inference
```
Solution: Use release build instead of debug
Run: flutter run --release
Ensure device has sufficient memory
```

**Issue**: Database errors
```
Solution: Clear app data and reinstall
For Android: Settings > Apps > App Name > Storage > Clear Data
For iOS: Delete and reinstall app
```
